## üì¨ **Temp-Mail Python API Wrapper** - For Anonymous Temporary Email Addresses

Welcome to the **Temp-Mail Python API Wrapper**! This Python script allows you to access temporary email addresses from **temp-mail.org**. Temp-Mail provides free temporary and anonymous email addresses, which is ideal for testing purposes, avoiding spam, and maintaining your privacy.
